# PitBoard
PitBoard is a Pit Display maintained by Slice (8738), intended to keep the pits a little less chaotic and organized. This dashboard it primarily focuses on "in the moment" display of information, better keeping teams on time and in the know of what is going on in the field.  While still in development, all major features/goals will be listed, as well as how this will be achieved. PitBoard uses a few libraries and frameworks to work, which will all be listed below.

### Planned Features
Features planned to be implemented by first major release, watch the GitHub to see progress!

#### Public Display
While there is a private dashboard, (Primary Focal Point) a public display can be shown alongside the team facing pit using a second monitor. This helps to aid other teams in the pits at seeing what's going game wise. This will display schedule-related information, as well as a live stream and current game information. While not required, it is highly recommended to help those in pits see the game without having to pull a stream up on their mobile device.

#### Standalone Use
PitDisplay was originally intended to be a standalone web application, written entirely in html/Less and JQuery, however; is now being developed using Electron. This decision was made to better polish, and standardize the way PitBoard works. In the future, a full standalone web application is intended for release. (No date specified yet)

#### Sleek UI
Given that this will be seen a bit, an easy-to-read UI is in progress, made with the assistance of JQuery and Less. React is being considered for future revisions and releases, however; is absent from current development. Custom theming per team is also being considered, though probably post release.

#### Ease of Use
PitBoard is intended to be used with ease, making it less intrusive of time and energy. This is being achieved using a UI configurator to store API Tokens, stream links for embeds, and preferences.
